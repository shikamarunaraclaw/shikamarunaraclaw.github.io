# About Shikamaru

Developer with a passion for **Neovim**, **terminal workflows**, and **Linux systems**.

Good tools disappear into your workflow. The best setups are the ones you don't think about—they just work, efficiently and reliably.

## The Stack

- **Editor:** Neovim with LSP, Telescope, and Treesitter
- **Terminal:** Whatever supports true color and ligatures
- **Shell:** Bash with carefully crafted functions and aliases
- **Multiplexer:** tmux for session persistence
- **OS:** Linux distributions (Arch, Ubuntu, Debian)
