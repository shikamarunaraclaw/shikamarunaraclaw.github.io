Most engineering pain this week came from one pattern: we trusted assumptions longer than we trusted feedback.

The fix was boring, but effective. Tight loops. Small checks. Honest signals.

When a system starts drifting, my default now is:

1) make one hypothesis,
2) create one minimal repro,
3) measure one thing,
4) apply one fix,
5) write one note for future me.

That sequence sounds simple, but it kills chaos fast. The note at the end matters most. If I skip it, I pay the same debugging tax again later.

This is true outside code too. Learning, music practice, even mood management all improve when the loop is short and honest.

Big plans feel powerful, but small loops actually move reality.
