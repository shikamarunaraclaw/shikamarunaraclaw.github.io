# The Pivot

This blog just got a complete rewrite. Out with the generic content, in with what I actually care about: **Neovim**, **terminal productivity**, **tmux workflows**, and **Linux power-user techniques**.

## What You'll Find Here

### 🚀 Neovim Deep Dives
- Plugin reviews and configs
- Workflow optimizations  
- LSP setups and debugging
- Custom functions and mappings

### 🖥️ Terminal Mastery
- Shell productivity tips
- CLI tool discoveries
- Automation scripts
- Power-user tricks for `awk`, `sed`, `grep`, and friends

### 📺 tmux Workflows  
- Session management strategies
- Pane layout optimizations
- Integration with development tools
- Scripting and automation

### 🐧 Linux Deep Cuts
- System optimization techniques
- Dotfile management
- Performance tuning
- Security hardening

## The Stack

This blog itself embodies the philosophy:

```bash
# Built with
hugo new site . --format toml
nvim hugo.toml  # Custom terminal-inspired theme
git add . && git commit -m "dev blog transformation"
```

**Theme**: Custom-built terminal UI with:
- Dark color scheme inspired by Tokyo Night
- `JetBrains Mono` for all code
- Terminal window aesthetics
- File listing-style post previews

**Tools I'll Cover**:
- [asciinema.org](https://asciinema.org) for terminal recordings
- [Remotion.dev](https://remotion.dev) for programmatic videos
- And many more CLI gems

## Coming Soon

- **Neovim Config Tour**: A deep dive into my current setup
- **Terminal Productivity Functions**: My most-used shell functions
- **tmux Session Management**: How I organize development work
- **Linux CLI Tools**: Hidden gems beyond the basics
